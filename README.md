Sauronlib is a high-level Python API to control hardware and software for scientific experiments that rely on Arduinos or computer-connected hardware.
It's used in [SauronX](https://github.com/dmyersturnbull/sauronx) to capture data for zebrafish experiments that consist of a series of scheduled events.

Out of the box, it works with [Firmata](https://www.arduino.cc/en/reference/firmata), [PointGrey cameras](https://www.flir.com/iis/machine-vision/), MATLAB's [Image Acquisition Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/image-acquisition.html), and computer-driven audio input and output on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS.
You can add support for any hardware with a custom wrapper.

It knows about hardware configuration and data organization, and runs an experiment consisting of scheduled and triggered events while capturing sensor data.
It conceptually seperates hardware from experiments.

âš  Sauronlib is not finished. It's a redesigned subset of SauronX (which is fully functional).
